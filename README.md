Pretty hard to find these online ive noticed, so i decided to find and post them myself!




----------------------[houses (items)]----------------------
* start by opening up the console by clicking F12 or using selecting more tools.
  - type 'houses' and click enter.
  - arrays should now pop up, each are labeled by the character/name.
  - under whichever one you would like to edit, look where it says 'x: xxxx'
  - the main important ones are "4: xxxx" and "9: xxxx", but feel free to mess with the others too.
  - "xxxx" being whatever number you currently have/are limited too.



----------------------[accomp (achievements]----------------------
* once again start with opening the developer console
  - now, this is even easier.
  - you can simply type accomp[x][2] = 1 // 0 being locked, 1 being unlocked.
  - now, for 'x', that can be any number 0-22 as there is a total of 22 achievements. have fun!
